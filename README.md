# Data-Structure-Project
Missing Features:
Castling

Need to work on:
-Make system using bitboard (having a single array of bits/peices to represent all the pieces)
-Implement FEN notation for easier board creation
-Make seperate direction of movement on the bitboard/single array:
    west = -1, east = +1, north = +8, south = -8
    nw = +7, ne = +9
    sw = -7, se = -9
